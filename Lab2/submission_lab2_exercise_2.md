## Question for each part

a. What is the behavior?
b. Is there a memory error? If there is a memory error, explain the rationale for the memory error.
If there is no memory error, explain why it isnâ€™t a memory error. You should also explain the
reason for the result and what happened. Your explanation should be clear, refer to the code
and justify the behavior observed.


### 1
#### a

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

#### b

Case 1 has an instruction ```p = 0;``` which reassigns p to 0. We can add ```printf("%p",NULL);``` at the start of main to observe that NULL value is also 0. That is, p is assigned to the NULL pointer. Also, address 0x00 is owned by the operating system, not the program. Invoking ```setvalue()```, program will attempt to dereference the NULL pointer ```p``` which is not owned by the program. Hence the segmentation fault.
