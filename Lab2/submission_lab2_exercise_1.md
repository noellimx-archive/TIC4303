## Why are the addresses printed in hex rather than decimal?

A hexidecimal digit represents 4 binary digits. i.e 0x7ffef87cc6fc == 0b011111111111111011111000011111001100011011111100. It is much more human-readable to display in hex. Also, address bus sizes are usually in shifts of 8 bits which can be represented by 2 hexes.
