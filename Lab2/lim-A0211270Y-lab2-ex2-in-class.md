## Question for each part

a. What is the behavior?
b. Is there a memory error? If there is a memory error, explain the rationale for the memory error.
If there is no memory error, explain why it isnâ€™t a memory error. You should also explain the
reason for the result and what happened. Your explanation should be clear, refer to the code
and justify the behavior observed.

### 1
#### a)

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

#### b)

Case 1 has an instruction ```p = 0;``` which reassigns p to 0. We can add ```printf("%p",NULL);``` at the start of main to observe that NULL value is also 0. That is, p is assigned to the NULL pointer. Also, address 0x00 is owned by the operating system, not the program. Invoking ```setvalue()```, program will attempt to dereference the NULL pointer ```p``` which is not owned by the program. Also, since 0x00 does not point to any variable, assigning an r-value to ```*p``` is illogical. Hence the segmentation fault.

#### b-inclass)

address not in mmap. [mmap address at zero](https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/address_zero.html)

### 2

#### a)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

#### b)

```p``` is assigned to ```hello``` which is a pointer to a string literal. String literals are static and not modifiable. That is, the character elements in ```hello``` cannot be replaced. However, reading/access is allowed. 

```

    *p; // legal
    printf("%c",*p); // legal
    *p = 'W'; // illegal, undefined behavior
```

### 3

#### a)
program returns 0

#### b)

```string``` is an array of element type ```char```. Unlike c-string, it is not null-terminated and elements are modifiable.



### 4

#### a)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

#### b)

```p``` is assigned to NULL, and dereferencing NULL is an undefined behavior (RHS value is undefined in the assignment to int ```choice```);

### 5

#### a)
program returns 0

#### b)
First, observe ```printf("%i", sizeof(char *) == sizeof(int *));``` is 1 (true), that is size of a char pointer and int pointer is the same. Size-wise, pointer type-cast from ```int *``` to ```char *``` is legal. Second, ```sizeof(int) == 4``` and ```sizeof(char) == 1```. As long as we assign to ```*p``` an r-value that is within 1 byte (8-bits), the program will not complain. Otherwise, value will overflow.


### 8

#### a)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

#### b)
0x40000000 is not mapped in the program (program is not aware of the space region).
